/**
 * @file ProgressionEngine.swift
 * @brief Applies feedback-driven progression logic to structured weekly workouts.
 *
 * The ProgressionEngine is responsible for intelligently adjusting training volume based on a user's feedback and performance.
 * It uses principles from hypertrophy-focused training to optimize long-term muscle growth while minimizing risk of overtraining.
 *
 * ### Intended Behavior:
 * - Adds up to +2 total sets per muscle per week across all workouts if:
 *   - The muscle is prioritized in the plan
 *   - Current volume is below the hypertrophy upper bound
 *   - No soreness, pain, or fatigue-related feedback blocks progression
 * - Soreness:
 *   - If a muscle is sore *and being trained that day*, one set is removed from the previous workout that also trained it.
 * - Joint Pain:
 *   - Flags next week's exercises that target muscles near the affected joint.
 *   - Block progression for those muscles and flag the UI for user awareness.
 * - Fatigue:
 *   - If a workout receives `.completelyDrained` feedback, 2 sets are removed from high-volume exercises in that workout next week.
 *   - That workout is skipped during volume progression.
 * - "Too Much" Feedback:
 *   - If a user gives `.tooMuch` feedback on an exercise, that exercise loses 1 set in the same slot next week (if > 1 set).
 *   - No new sets will be added to it.
 *
 * ### Usage:
 * - The engine is triggered once per week after the final workout of that week is completed.
 * - It receives two consecutive weeks of workouts via a 2D array (`weeklyWorkouts[week][day]`).
 * - Feedback is attached directly to the `WorkoutEntity` and `ExerciseInstanceEntity` types.
 * - Progression is applied only to the second week in the input array.
 *
