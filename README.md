# Dedset 🏋️‍♂️  
*A focused, minimal weightlifting app built for lifters, by a lifter.*

## 💡 What is Dedset?

**Dedset** is a work-in-progress weightlifting app designed with one goal:  
> To be the app I actually want to use over anything else.

It focuses on speed, clarity, and clean UI — without the bloat of other lifting apps. Inspired by the needs of hybrid athletes and data-driven lifters.
